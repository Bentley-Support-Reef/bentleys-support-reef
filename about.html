        <h2>21 Weeks and 5 Days</h2>

        <p>
          At just 21 weeks and 5 days gestation, Amanda experienced PPROM —
          preterm premature rupture of membranes. We were admitted to 
          HealthPark Medical Center, Antepartum Floor in Fort Myers, Florida.
        </p>

        <p>
          A NICU doctor sat with us and explained that if labor began
          before 22 weeks, no life-saving measures would be attempted.
          We were living hour by hour.

        <p>
          Bentley was delivered via emergency C-section after sudden
          drops in his heart rate. He weighed 1 pound, 4 ounces.
        </p>

        <p>
          He entered the world at the very edge of viability —
          where survival statistics are low and uncertainty is constant.

        <h2>176 Days in the NICU</h2>

        <p>
          Bentley spent 176 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
          Every day brought new challenges — respiratory complications,
          procedures, medications, and setbacks.
        </p>

        <p class="father-voice">
          As his father, I learned that strength is not loud.
          It is quiet consistency — showing up every day,
          sitting beside an incubator, believing in a future
          you cannot yet see.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our family learned what it means to live inside a hospital,
          balancing hope with realism.

        <h2>The PICU and Critical Nights</h2>

        <p>
          In February 2025, during a stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,
          doctors told us on two separate occasions that Bentley
          might not make it through the night.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote class="pull-quote">
          "There were nights we were told to prepare for goodbye. Nights we
          had to scramble to arrange family to help with our other two children.
          Nights filled crying and praying for god to spare our child. But every night,
          morning came."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Those moments changed us forever.

        <h2>Coming Home</h2>

        <p>
          Today, Bentley is home. He remains on a ventilator
          with a tracheostomy for respiratory support,
          receives oxygen therapy, and is fed through a G-J tube.
        </p>

        <p>
          He takes 15 medications daily and participates in
          physical and occupational therapy.
        </p>

        <p>
          His fight continues — but it continues at home.

        <p>
          What began as one father sharing updates
          has reached more than 14 million people worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bentley’s journey has inspired families walking similar paths,
          showing that resilience can exist even in uncertainty.

        <h2>The Foundation in the Making</h2>

        <p>
          Extended NICU and PICU stays create financial and emotional
          strain that many families are unprepared for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our vision is to build a foundation that provides relief,
          resources, and support to families facing prolonged
          hospitalizations due to medical complications.
